### How to Use:

Not sure what to cook for tonight's dinner? Look no further than JJT Foods! With this application you are able to generate random recipes with a full link to the actual recipe and you can also view menus in our search bar! For example, let's say you wanted to order from McDonald's, simply type "McDonald's" in the search bar and boom! You get the full menu. What if you are craving a burger and not sure where to get it from? Simply type 'burger' in the search bar and boom! You will get a list of burgers from A LOT of restaurants - too many to count! This was inspired from one of my instructor's passion for cooking, JJT is an acronym of the 3 instructors we had.

### Approach Taken:

I wanted to make sure that the site was as simple and clean as possible, so the first thing I wanted to do was wireframe a very basic and simple layout. For an application such as this one I wanted to make sure that it was just simple and effective - nothing too fancy to take away from the purpose of the site. From there, I created 3 components - App, FoodInfo, and Random. Food Info is of course the menu items and Random is the random recipe generator. These were both accomplished with the help of an API I found on rapidapi.com
